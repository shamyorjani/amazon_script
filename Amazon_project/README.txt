Amazon Web Scraping with Selenium and BeautifulSoup
======================================

This Python script uses Selenium and BeautifulSoup to scrape product information from Amazon based on ASINs (Amazon Standard Identification Numbers) provided in an Excel spreadsheet. It then updates the spreadsheet with the extracted data.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Selenium: You can install it using `pip install selenium`
- Chrome WebDriver: Make sure you have Chrome installed, and download the appropriate WebDriver for your Chrome version. Place the WebDriver executable in the same directory as this script.

## Usage
1. Prepare your data:
   - Create an Excel workbook named `Macro_file.xlsx` (or change the filename in the script) with a sheet containing ASINs in column A, starting from row 2.
   
2. Set up the Chrome extension:
   - Place the Amazon Chrome extension (CRX file) in the same directory as this script and update the `extension_path` variable with the correct path to the CRX file.

3. Run the script:
   - Execute the script in your Python environment.

4. Wait for the script to complete:
   - The script will navigate to Amazon product pages, scrape information, and update the Excel sheet for each ASIN.

## Important Notes
- The script assumes that the ASINs are in column A of the Excel sheet.
- It utilizes Selenium to automate the web browser and handle pop-ups, such as cookie consent dialogs.
- BeautifulSoup is used to parse the HTML content of the Amazon product pages.
- Extracted information includes product title, brand, price, Best Sellers Rank, review count, sales number, average review rating, and the rank category.
- If an ASIN is sponsored or not found, the script will skip to the next ASIN.

## Output
- The script will print the extracted information for each ASIN to the console.
- The Excel sheet `Macro_file.xlsx` will be updated with the extracted data in columns B to I for each ASIN.

## Troubleshooting
- Make sure you have the required dependencies installed and the Chrome WebDriver in place.
- Check for any errors or exceptions during script execution.
